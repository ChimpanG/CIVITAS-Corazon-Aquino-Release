			<Text>Corazon Aquino was born in 1933 to Jos√© Cojuangco, a former congressman, and his wife Demetria. Both of her parents came from influential families. She attended university in the United States before returning to the Philippines to study law at Far Eastern University. During her studies, she met Benigno 'Ninoy' S. Aquino, Jr, and they wed. Ninoy was active as a politican - and Corazon secretly helped fund his candidacy by selling off part of her inheritance. He rose up the ranks, eventually becoming the youngest Senator in the country. He became an outspoken critic of President Ferdinand Marcos, and when Marcos declared martial law and abolished the constitution in 1972, Corazon's husband was among the first to be imprisoned. Six years later, their family would leave for exile in the United States. Together Ninoy and Corazon lived a happy life, but in 1983, Ninoy returned to the Philippines and was promptly assassinated on the tarmac of Manila International Airport.</Text>

			<Text>Corazon Aquino returned to the Philippines shortly after; she led Ninoy's funeral procession, in which more than two million people participated. The assassination of her husband flung Corazon into politics as she became an active anti-Marcos figure. After Ferdinand Marcos announced a snap election for early 1986, she received one million signatures urging her to run. Marcos spoke out against her, critiquing her lack of experience and her gender, to which she countered with stinging rebukes of Marcos's corruption. The election on February 7, 1986 was marred by widespread electoral fraud, leading to Marcos being declared the winner. In protest, Corazon held a "People's Victory Rally," which drew an enormous crowd. Just 18 days after the election, Ferdinand Marcos fled the country after several military officers broke with him and offered their support to Aquino's claim to victory in the election. </Text>

			<Text>This People Power Revolution signaled the end of authoritarian rule in the Philippines, earning Corazon the nicknames "Mother of Philippine Democracy" and "The Housewife Who Led a Revolution." She immediately issued a Proclamation to establish a new government, issuing a provisional Freedom Constitution until a more formal document could be ratified. She also promulgated two landmark legal codes and re-organized the Supreme Court to be more independent. She tackled the large amount of foreign debt left by the Marcos regime, reducing the Philippines debt-to-GDP ration by 30 percent, partially by popularizing the Philippines as a tourist destination, marketing the country as the "Fiesta Islands" with a distinct culture and exquisite natural beauty. She also oversaw land and agrarian reform in the country, breaking up large estates in favor of those who worked the fields. She also dealt with several natural disasters during her presidency, including the 1990 Luzon earthquake, the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo, and 1991's Tropical Storm Thelma. Despite her prominence and popularity, Corazon refused to run for a second term, choosing to abide by the term limits of the Constitution even though it was established after her election. She continued to be active in charitable, social, and political endeavors up until her death on August 1, 2009. The Philippines mourned the loss of the Housewife Who Led a Revolution with nation-wide requiem masses and a funeral escort attended by hundreds of thousands of Filipinos.</Text>
